# Classification-and-Captioning-Aircraft-Damage-Using-Pretrained-Models
✈️ Classification & Captioning Aircraft Damage
This project uses deep learning and pretrained models to classify aircraft damage images and generate natural-language captions/summaries. It combines VGG16 for image classification with BLIP for automated description generation, enabling a streamlined approach to aircraft inspection and reporting.

🔹 Features
Aircraft Damage Classification using VGG16 (transfer learning)

Caption Generation with BLIP pretrained model

Image Summarization for quick incident reporting

Custom Keras Layer integration

Visualization of training metrics and predictions

🔹 Tech Stack
Python, TensorFlow/Keras

VGG16, BLIP (Hugging Face Transformers)

Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization
